Machine Learning Projects: Clustering & Logistic Regression
Project Overview

This repository contains machine learning implementations focusing on unsupervised learning (Clustering) and supervised learning (Logistic Regression). The projects demonstrate end-to-end workflows including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result interpretation using Python.

The repository is intended for learning, experimentation, and demonstration of core machine learning concepts.
