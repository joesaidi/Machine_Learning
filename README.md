## Machine Learning Projects: Clustering & Logistic Regression
Project Overview

This repository contains machine learning implementations focusing on unsupervised learning (Clustering) and supervised learning (Logistic Regression). The projects demonstrate end-to-end workflows including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result interpretation using Python.

The repository is intended for learning, experimentation, and demonstration of core machine learning concepts.

Data normalization and scaling

Cluster visualization

Evaluation using methods such as:

Elbow Method

Silhouette Score

Use Cases

Customer segmentation

Pattern discovery

Exploratory data analysis
